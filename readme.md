# Heterosctructures Properties Calculations

This repository contains modules for calculating properties of quantum heterostructures.

Its is possible to calculate eigenstates and eigenvalues for bound states found inside the desired structures. It is also possible to calculate photocurrent, due to photons incidence.

It is a free software, use as you wish, and please share with me the issues you find, so we can improve it together.

## Quantum well with double barrier for wavelength selection

It is a Quantum Well surrounded by two barriers. The structure is made of $Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}As/GaAs$. It is possible to vary the barriers' length, as well as the well's length and the displacement between the barriers and the well.

The structure is carried as a two dimensional bulk, with dimensions $L_x \sim \lambda_f \ll L_y, L_z$. Where $\lambda_f$ is the wavelength of the incident photons. It allows the system to be approached as a one dimension potential in the growth direction.

Such a device allows for narrow wavelength selection window. It is possible to simulate the photocurrent due to photons with different energies.

Current peaks will be observed for photons with energies near to the difference in energy between the bound states found inside the barriers-well electron trap.

Varying the well's length, as well as the barriers' and the displacement's length, it is possible to achieve different wavelength selector devices.
